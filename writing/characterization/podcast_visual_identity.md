## Gregory M. Kapfhammer

## Re-type the sentence "I adhered to the Allegheny College Honor Code while completing this project."

TODO: You must retype the sentence here in order to digitally sign your pledge.

**IMPORTANT:** If you do not type the required sentence then the course
instructor will not know that you adhered to the Allegheny College Honor Code
while completing the project.

## ðŸŽ¤ Podcast Title

**Important**: You must describe your podcast's visual identity around the name
of either **Major Breakthroughs** or **Major Muses** since the podcast's

one of the two approved names. Is is also important to note that the name of the
